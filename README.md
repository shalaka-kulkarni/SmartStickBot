#Description 
The aim of our project was to build a program for the Firebird bot such that it is able to traverse from one point to another (as desired by the user) while detecting all obstacles ( obstacles at a height, obstacles beneath the ground level like potholes) and avoiding them. 
This project has been visualized with the intention of creating a smart guide for a visually impaired person to avoid obstacles on the road and walk safely from one place to another.
